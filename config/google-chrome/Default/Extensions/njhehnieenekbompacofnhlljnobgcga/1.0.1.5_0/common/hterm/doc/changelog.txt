1.17, 2013-07-26, Double-click to select url-ish.

* On double-click, expand the text selection to make it easy to select URLs
  or other interesting substrings.

1.16, 2013-07-25, More fix newline regression.

* 1.15 got the treatment of the areas above/below the scroll region wrong.

1.15, 2013-07-25, Fix newline regression.

* getVTScrollBottom returns the row count if there is no vt scroll region in
  effect, need to read the vtScrollBottom_ property directly instead.

* BUG=chromium:223140, Terminal viewer doesn't handle horizontally split curses
  application correctly.
* Fix the hterm.windowType detection to not barf when hterm is used in a
  Chrome packaged app.

1.13, 2013-07-17, Disable zoom warning on newer Chrome builds.

* New builds of Chrome removed document.width/height, so we're not able to use
  them to detect the zoom factor.  Disabled zoom detection when these properties
  are missing until we have a better solution.
* Fix libdot/changelog/(version|date) resources.
* Fix jscompiler errors.
* Stop printing "CSI K", "CSI ? J", and "ESC #" sequences with bad params.

  encodings can be set independently.
* Refactor Terminal.keyboard.onKeyDown_ to allow Ctrl+Alt+(printable) key
  combinations.
* Fix regression in Terminal..onPaste_.

1.10, 2013-06-20, Add 'character-encoding' preference.

* Adds a 'character-encoding' preference which can be set to 'utf-8' (default)
  or 'raw'.  When set to 'utf-8' hterm's behavior is unchanged from previous
  versions.  When set to 'raw', hterm will not attempt to decode input or
  encode output.

1.9, 2013-06-19, Fix issues with shift-key and CSI sequences.

* Clear e.shiftKey in hterm_keyboard_keymap.js' sh() function so that
  hterm_keyboard.js doesn't apply its own shift key munging.

1.8, 2013-05-31, overscroll fix

* BUG=chromium:245700: Call preventDefault on mousewheel events that we've
  handled.

* Pass width and height in io.onTerminalResize again, which regressed in the
  previous commit.
* BUG=245120: Add 'enable-dec12' preference, off by default, which allows the
  host to control the cursor blink state via DEC private mode 12.

1.6, 2013-05-24, Track terminal size on the io object.

* This installs a default onTerminalResize handler on the hterm.Terminal.IO
  object that records the most recent terminal size as io.columnCount and
  io.rowCount.  This gives consumers synchronous access to these values without
  having to wire up the event handler themselves.

1.5, 2013-04-18, Pass shift-ctrl-L

* BUG=chromium:233008, PASS shift-ctrl-L (CrOS screen lock combo)

* Break out of a parseUntilStringTerminator_ if an embedded ESC is
  found (other than the one that may appear as part of a 7-bit ST),
  or if the sequence has been going on for too long (measured by the
  wall clock).
* BUG=chromium:191050, Map Chrome OS top-row keys to function keys.
* BUG=chromum-os:30792, beeps accumulate - leads to non stop beeping
* BUG=chromum-os:35288, scroll-on-output doesn't appear to work
